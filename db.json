An IoT based system providing error free measurement of various soil parameters and a user-friendly mobile application for the farmers & the authorities comprises the system. The mobile application that provides timely alerts on all possible outbreaks & plant diseases in a particular region & also informing the farmers about the preventive measures is the greatest highlight of the system.

There we came up with our idea to lessen the hardships of women and to stand in solidarity with women in farmlands. Women have significant and crucial role in agriculture. But they are often side-lined in this sector. The gender inequality that still prevails in this industry narrows the food production. While interacting with lot of women farmers and with thorough background research we understood that the gender specific obstacles mainly occur in financing, marketing and in access to land.",

If there is an extra hurdle to find it because you are a woman makes it worse. Also, the inequality in market price is also a discrimination faced by women. So, our application provides facilities to find out the current market trend, nearest profitable market and to forecast the price of the chosen crop.",
